      1.Purpose
    </p>
    <p>
      This document sets out our policy for responding to requests for deletion of data under the GDPR (General Data
      Protection Regulation), which comes into force in May 2018. This document explains the rights of the data subject
      in relation to data deletion and the responsibilities of Rummy Guru in responding with such a request.
    </p>
    <p>

      2. Individual Rights
    </p>
    <p>
      An individual has the right to erasure, also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’. The principle underpinning this
      right is to enable an individual to request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling
      reason for its continued processing.
    </p>
    <p>

      3.When does the right to erasure apply?
    </p>
    <p>
      As stipulated in the GDPR, individuals have a right to have personal data erased and to prevent processing in
      specific circumstances:
    </p>
    <p>
      • Where the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was originally
      collected/processed;
    </p>
    <p>
      • When the individual withdraws consent;
    </p>
    <p>
      • When the individual objects to the processing and there is no other legal ground for the relevant processing
      activity;
    </p>
    <p>
      • When the personal data was unlawfully processed;
    </p>
    <p>
      • Where the personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation.
    </p>
    <p>

      4.What information does Rummy Guru retain?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rummy Guru We collect information you provide when registration in order to use Rummy Guru,
      including your personal information such as your name, email address, credit card number and/or any other personal
      information, and login information such as session start/stop time, time zone, and network connection type (e.g.,
      WiFi, cellular), your KYC document/PAN card number. Such information facilitates your use of, or getting paid by,
      Rummy Guru We need such information to manage our services so that you do not have to login in Rummy Guru each time when you use Rummy Guru.
    </p>
    <p>


      5.How can data be deleted?
    </p>
    <p>
      A system administrator (individual user acting on behalf of their organization) can delete data from their
      Interplace system whenever they wish. This data is deleted from the system immediately and cannot be recovered by
      any users or Rummy Guru employees after this point. Data which has been deleted or otherwise destroyed can
      not be recovered at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sufficient warning is given to the account administrator before they permanently delete anything. I
      www.rummyguru-apk.in I service@rummyguru-apk.in
    </p>
    <p>

      Data Deletion Policy Data may still remain in the systems back-up files, which will be deleted periodically.
      Information may be deleted from our system upon request to service@rummyguru-apk.in. We undertake to perform the
      deletion within one month (30 calendar days) and will send you a confirmation once the information has been
      deleted. Wherever possible, we will aim to complete the request in advance of the deadline.
